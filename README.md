# nielx

This repository contains my public [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
configurations.  The documentation is a bit lacking and will probably
continue that way, but you might find it useful if you need a setup
close to what I have.

I have a separate private configuration (containing passwords and other
sensitive information) that uses this repository as its base.

I'm also using a few NixOS-related community projects:

- [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
- [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv)
